                  Each day, more than 3,000 kids, over one million a year,
                  become regular smokers. One-third of them will die prematurely
                  from tobacco-related diseases. Several factors contribute to
                  this national health epidemic, including the roughly $5
                  billion tobacco companies spend each year on advertising and
                  marketing to attract new smokers. More than 30% of our
                  population smokes or chews. This deadly addiction kills more
                  than 400,000 Americans each year. More than 90% of all regular
                  smokers began using tobacco at or before age 18!
