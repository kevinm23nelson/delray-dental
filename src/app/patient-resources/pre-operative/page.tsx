If you feel you will have any problem keeping your appointment, please give us as much notice as possible so that we might utilize your time for another patient.`,

    `Generally, patients are provided with three prescriptions prior to the surgical visit. The first prescription is an antibiotic and it should be started 24 hours before the scheduled surgery. The second prescription is an antibacterial mouth rinse. This too should be started one week prior to the surgery. The antibiotics are usually taken four times a day: once every 6 hours. The rinse is used in the morning after brushing your teeth and at night before bed. The third prescription is for any discomfort that you might have after the surgery. Fill that prescription and have the medication available if you should need it.`,

    `Please wear loose fitting clothing for the surgery. You may eat before the surgery since there will be no general anesthetic, but only a light meal is indicated. Stock up on some soft foods and liquids for the initial post-operative course.`,

    `You will be given a chemical ice pack after the surgery. That should be sufficient to get you home. Once at home, make sure that you have enough ice and the means of making an ice pack to use throughout the first two post-operative days.`,

    `You will have stitches in your mouth after the surgery. Whether or not you can use your temporary prosthesis will be discussed with you prior to surgery. If Dr. Ritota feels that it is best, for the success of the implant surgery, that you do not wear your temporary prosthesis, you are urged to comply. Pressure from a temporary prosthesis on healing implants can cause movement and loss of integration and that would cause failure!`,
